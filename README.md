## Central Server Responsibilities:
1. Broadcast Transaction:
When a user adds a new transaction, the central server broadcasts it to all connected miners.

2. Manage Transaction Pool:
The server adds the transaction to its own transaction pool and removes transactions that are already included in a mined block.

3. Broadcast New Transactions:
The server keeps miners updated by broadcasting new transactions regularly.

4. Verify and Add Block:
Once a block is mined by any miner, the central server verifies it and broadcasts the new block to the rest of the miners.

5. Adjust Difficulty:
After receiving each new block, the server adjusts the difficulty level to maintain a steady block time.

## Miner Server Responsibilities:
1. Receive Transactions:
Each miner receives new transactions from the central server and maintains its own transaction pool.

2. Mine Blocks:
Miners mine blocks at a fixed interval by performing Proof of Work (PoW). This involves finding a valid hash based on the difficulty level.

3. Broadcast Mined Block:
After successfully mining a block, the miner broadcasts it to the central server, which further distributes it to all other miners.

4. Verify Block:
Each miner verifies the received block and checks if the chain is valid. Smaller or erroneous chains are rejected.

5. Update Blockchain:
The miner updates its local copy of the blockchain and adjusts the mining difficulty based on the central serverâ€™s broadcast.
